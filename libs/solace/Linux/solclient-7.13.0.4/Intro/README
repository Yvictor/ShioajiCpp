        Solace Corporation Messaging API for C Introductory Sample Programs

INTRODUCTION

   These samples provide a basic introduction to using the Messaging API for
   C in messaging applications. Common uses, such as sending a direct message,  
   receiving a direct message, sending a guaranteed message, and receiving a
   guaranteed message, are described in detail in these samples.

   To clearly illustrate the message API concepts, error checking and handling 
   is not included.  To see advanced samples with robust error handling and 
   checking, see the 'ex/' sample directory.

   Before working with these samples, ensure that you have read and understood
   the  basic  concepts  found in the Solace Corporation Messaging API for Java, 
   C, and .NET User Guide.
